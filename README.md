The R script has been developed by Dr Renato Filjar, Dr Oliver Jukić, and Prof Jasna Prpić-Oršić, for the purpose of research presented in manuscript 'A Stochastic Gradient Boosting prediction model of GNSS ionospheric delay during a short-term rapidly developing geomagnetic storm for sub-equatorial region with geomagnetic field density components as predictors', authored by Renato Filjar, Oliver Jukić, Jasna Prpić-Oršić, and Serdjo Kos. This software may contain pieces of code taken from description of various R packages and examples. It is provided on the as-is basis, for the sole purpose of reproducibility of our research. We do not accept any liability for possible errors and mis-interpretations.
